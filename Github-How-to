This file is here to keep track of git commands that i may forget and need a refresher on function with! May expand to include helpful tips, we'll see i guess!

Index.
1. Common commands
2. Forking


1. Common commands:
# git commands always have git infront 

Cloning a repository
- git clone {url}
The above creates a copy of the git repository at stated URL on local machine. 

Staging a change
 Making it so the file(s) is included in the next commit basically

git add . # at root,
git add --all # more generally 
## Adding all the updated files to the next commit

git add {file} # Adding a specific file(s) to the next commit

git add *.txt # Adds all .txt files etc.

Setting config in local machine
### Needed to commit changes to the repository

# globally - machine
git config --global user.name "[USERNAME]"
git config --global user.email "[EMAIL]"

#Locally - Just this repository
git config user.name "[USERNAME]"
git config user.email "[EMAIL]"

Local Repository Status 
# Check local repository state ( like whats staged / already git add etc)
git status

Commiting a Change 
# " save " the staged changes
git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"

Pushing Changes (git push)
# Updating remote repository with committed changes
# Remote origin, remote_branch main, for example

git push -u [REMOTE] [REMOTE_BRANCH] 

Pulling changes
#The opposite of push, pulling remote changes to local repository

git pull [REMOTE] [REMOTE_BRANCH]

Ignoring files

* ignore listed
**/ ignore file or folder in repository

2. Forking
# You can copy another persons repository to your github page and make a copy by forking it, top right of a github page
# Then just clone and download it etc, some useful things to know when forking.

remote -v # check status of fork clone
fetch , push can also be used.

git remote add upstream [URL] # Adds the original fork-ee ( or someone elses fork) as an upstream to update from

git merge upstream/main # Merges upstream main to origin main ( local repos)

# Can then push to update your own remote fork.

3. Branching
